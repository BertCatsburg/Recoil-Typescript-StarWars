# What's this??
Well, it a very simple App getting some data from the StarWars API and putting it on the screen.

The intention of this App is to get some feeling of a stable, robust technology-stack to be used in UI

# Installation
clone and install and run:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:BertCatsburg/Recoil-Typescript-StarWars.git
cd Recoil-Typescript-StarWars
npm i
npm start
```
# Technologies used
This is a test of the a numer of techniques combined:
- ReactJS
- Recoil for database/API access
- Create-React-App as the Framework
- Typescript
- Material-UI (a bit)
- React-Hook-Form


## Recoil
We need a very simple state-management lib. And Recoil seems to do the trick

## Create-React-App
After playing around with NextJS I'm fed up with all the hassle of SSR.

That's why CRA, and I'll put SSR in later. 

Played around with Razzle, did not get it to work. 
But other methods also look promising.

## Typescript
Ok, ok, I hate Typescript also, but it seems to be the future. 
And when you get the hang of it (placing 'any' everywhere Typescript complaints :-) ), you'l be ok. 

## Material-UI
The standard UI-lib. Logical choice nowadays

## React-Hook-Form
My goto Lib for Form-handling
